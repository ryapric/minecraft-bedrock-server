# This is the only file that you should back up, really. You may add any
# Minecraft Bedrock config options at the bottom of this file, exactly as you
# would find them in the usual `server.properties` file, with three caveats: use
# YAML keys instead of the regular INI format, replace any hyphens/dashes with
# underscores in those keys, and set boolean values as explicit strings (wrapped
# in quotes, e.g. "true").

# Bedrock server variables
bedrock_server_version: "1.16.0.2"
bedrock_server_ip: "1.1.1.1"

# EC2 instance types for the server.
# - t3a.micro (2C/0.5GB) is probably what you want running all the time.
# t3a.xlarge is what you want for the cheapest 4 cores, t3a.2xlarge for 8, etc.
instance_type: "t3a.micro" # t3a.xlarge is what you want for the cheapest 4 cores, t3a.2xlarge for 8, etc.

# Needed to whitelist SSH access to the server host
my_ip: "2.2.2.2"

# Restrict access to Gamertags you recognize
whitelisted_gamertags:
  - "you"
  - "yourFriend"

# Optional; CloudFormation will use these to restrict IP access to the server
# itself. If you don't care, then just leave "0.0.0.0/0". Note that if you don't
# set whitelisted Gamertag entries, anyone can join your server if they know the
# IP!
whitelisted_cidrs:
  - "2.2.2.2/32" # your own IP
  - "3.3.3.3/32" # your friend
  - "4.4.4.4/32" # another friend
  - "0.0.0.0/0" # anyone at all

# Set Operators for your server. The only reliable way to find these, is to
# watch the server logs when people log in
operator_xuids:
  - "abc123" # you
  - "xyz789" # friend

# Keypair name in AWS, for connecting to the Bedrock server host

# SSH private keyfile paths for Ansible to use
local_aws_keyfile: "/local/path/to/aws/pemkey.pem"
